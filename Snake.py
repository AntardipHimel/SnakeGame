# Explanation of the Code in Comments:

# Import Modules:
# random: Used for generating random coordinates for the food.
# curses: Used for handling terminal graphics and inputs.

# Initialize Curses and the Game Window:
# curses.initscr() starts the curses screen.
# The snake and food are displayed inside a window that fills the terminal.
# Cursor is hidden, and a timeout is set to control the game speed.

# Snake Initialization:
# The snake is represented by a list of coordinates, with the head being the first element.
# The snake starts at the middle-left part of the screen.

# Food Initialization:
# The food is placed at the center of the screen at the start of the game.
# The food is represented by an ASCII symbol (curses.ACS_PI).

# Game Loop:
# The game keeps running in an infinite loop until the player loses.
# The snake moves in the direction of the arrow key pressed by the player.
# The game checks for collisions with the walls or the snake's body.

# Snake Movement:
# The snake's head moves in the direction based on the key pressed.
# The rest of the body follows the head.

# Food Eating Logic:
# If the snake's head reaches the food, it grows (the tail is not removed).
# New food is placed at a random location that doesn't overlap the snake's body.

# Collision Detection:
# The game ends if the snake hits a boundary or itself.

# Drawing on Screen:
# The snake's position is updated on the screen with each movement.
# The food is redrawn at a new position after itâ€™s eaten.
